# Smart Maternal Risk Predictor

## Description  
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict maternal health risks. The model utilizes features such as age, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, body temperature, and heart rate to classify the risk levels as low, mid, or high risk.  

## Maternal Health Risk Prediction Model ü§∞  
The Maternal Health Risk Prediction Model is a powerful tool designed to predict risk levels associated with maternal health using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes Python and several libraries to analyze data and provide insights into maternal health risks.

## Key Features üéâ  
- **Data Loading:** Easily load maternal health datasets for analysis.  
- **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and correlations in maternal health data.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values and normalizing features.  
- **Risk Prediction:** Utilize a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict risk levels based on key health indicators.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance through accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

## How It Works üöÄ  
1. **Data Preparation:** Load the dataset and preprocess it by mapping categorical variables to numerical values and standardizing features.  
2. **Feature Selection:** Identify key features that influence maternal health risk.  
3. **Model Training:** Train the KNN classifier with the training dataset and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.  
4. **Prediction:** Make predictions on new data using the trained model.  
5. **Results Analysis:** Evaluate the model's performance using classification reports and confusion matrices.
